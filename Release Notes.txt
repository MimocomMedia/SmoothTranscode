This is an early development release of SmoothTranscode.

Advanced video codec options are currently unavailable.

Start and stop points have not yet been properly implemented and therefore may not work reliably.

SmoothTranscode is not yet able to deal with errors returned by FFmpeg, and therefore treats failed encodes the same as completed ones.
